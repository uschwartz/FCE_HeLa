##parameters chrLenFile and ploidy are required.

chrLenFile = ~/Analysis/FCE_HeLa/data/annotation/ChromInfo.txt
ploidy = 3


##Parameter "breakPointThreshold" specifies the maximal slope of the slope of residual sum of squares. 
##This should be a positive value. The closer it is to Zero, the more breakpoints will be called. Its recommended value is between 0.01 and 0.08.

breakPointThreshold = 3.


##Either coefficientOfVariation or window must be specified for whole genome sequencing data. Set window=0 for exome sequencing data.

window = 500000
step=50000

##Either chrFiles or GCcontentProfile must be specified too if no control dataset is available. 
##If you provide a path to chromosome files, Control-FREEC will look for the following fasta files in your directory (in this order): 
##1, 1.fa, 1.fasta, chr1.fa, chr1.fasta; 2, 2.fa, etc.
## Please ensure that you don't have other files but sequences having the listed names in this directory. 
chrFiles = ~/Analysis/FCE_HeLa/data/annotation/fasta/



outputDir =  ~/Analysis/FCE_HeLa//analysis/03_CNV



##If the parameter gemMappabilityFile is not specified, then the fraction of non-N nucleotides per window is used as Mappability.

gemMappabilityFile = ~/Analysis/FCE_HeLa/data/annotation/mappability_hg19/out50_hg19.gem
minMappabilityPerWindow = 0.8
